## About

[This project](https://github.com/Dikshabisht7/Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System/blob/be3bf935c37a2e9c7fc716320e570e709f750c8a/FRAS_Project.ipynb) is a `python-based` application which provides an involuntary attendance marking system that operates without human intervention. The system can also be used to maintain track of employees or students or other instructional activities where attendance is critical. In order to be recognised, students or employees must also register in the database. The user-friendly interface allows for on-the-spot registration. Using an admin account and password, the organization's admin can email the attendance of the day to the respective email address. Only the organization's administrators will have access to the attendance information, and no changes will be made to the attendance details. In this project, we used OpenCV's LBPH Face Recognizer and HaarCascade Classifiers for Face detection and recognition.
